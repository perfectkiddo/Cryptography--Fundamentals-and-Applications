## Introduction to Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It involves techniques for encrypting and decrypting messages to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. By using cryptographic algorithms and protocols, sensitive information can be protected from unauthorized access.

## Symmetric Encryption - AES
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency. In this section, you will learn how AES works and explore examples of encrypting and decrypting data using Python.

## Asymmetric Encryption - RSA
RSA is a popular asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses public and private keys for secure communication. Dive into the world of RSA encryption, key generation, and encryption/decryption processes to understand how asymmetric cryptography plays a crucial role in modern-day security.

## Digital Signatures
Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. Learn about the concept of digital signatures, how they are generated using cryptographic algorithms, and how they can be verified to ensure the integrity of the information.

## Common Cryptographic Combinations
Cryptographic protocols often combine multiple algorithms to achieve different security goals. Explore common combinations such as AES in CBC mode with HMAC for data encryption and integrity protection. Understand how these combinations enhance the overall security of cryptographic systems.

## Python Code Examples
All code examples in this repository are written in Python, making it easy for you to follow along and experiment with cryptographic techniques. From implementing AES encryption to generating RSA key pairs, the code snippets provided here will help you grasp the practical aspects of cryptography.
